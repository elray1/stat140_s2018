## Goal: identify causal associations

 * Establish whether there is a link between an **explanatory variable** and a **response variable**
 * Does changing the value of the explanatory variable **cause** the value of the response variable to change?
 * Example:
    * peanut consumption or avoidance is **explanatory variable**
    * peanut allergy is **response variable**

## 2 Types of Studies

 1. **Experiments**: The explanatory variable(s) are controlled by the researcher (and the researcher randomly assigns the value of the explanatory variable to each subject).
    * Researcher assigns babies to the peanut consumption or peanut avoidance groups

 2. **Observational** studies: the explanatory variable(s) are not manipulated or controlled by the researcher.
    * Babies either end up consuming peanut or avoiding peanuts, for reasons outside of the researcher's control.

 * To demonstrate a **causal** relationship, need to run an **experiment**.

## Confounding

 * A **confounder** is a variable that is associated with both the explanatory variable and the response variable, but is not in the `causal pathway'.
 
Example: Suppose we let families choose whether their child is in the peanut consumption group or the peanu avoidance group...

## Four Priciples of Experimental Design

**Goal: Prevent/Limit Confounding**

 * **Control**: Control sources of variation other than the factors we are testing by making conditions as similar as possible for all treatment groups.
    * If you give children in the peanut consumption group allergy medicine, also give it to children in the peanut avoidance group

 * **Randomization**: Subjects/experimental units are assigned to treatments at random to equalize the effects of unknown or uncontrollable sources of variation.

 * **Replication**: Each treatment is applied to more than one subject/experimental unit.
 
 * **Blocking**: Group together subjects/experimental units that are similar in important ways that you cannot control, then randomize the assignment of treatments within each of these groups, or blocks.
    * Block according to intial allergy test results.

## What to do in Observational Studies??

We can't do control or randomization or blocking!!

 * **Matching**: Find study participants who:
     * have different levels of the explanatory variables of interest, but
     * are similar in ways that are not directly being studied
     * compare values of the response variable between these matched participants.

This is the closest to blocking/randomization that you can get in an observational study.

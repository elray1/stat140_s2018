    "\n",
    "The data we're going to work with today have been gathered from a variety of sources by several people.  The Bechdel test ratings themselves are from www.bechdeltest.com, where the general public can rate movies according to whether they pass or fail the Bechdel test.  Some additional information about the movies comes from www.the-numbers.com.  These data were the basis of an article on the topic at http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/.  The data have since been added to the `fivethirtyeight` package for R.  I took those data and scraped some additional information about the movies like the MPAA rating, run time, and ratings from IMDB users from imdb.com (IMDB stands for \"Internet Movie Data Base\" -- it's a website that compiles lots of information about movies and lets users rate the movies).  Note that this is not a random sample of movies -- which movies made it into the data set was basically determined by which movies were rated by users of www.bechdeltest.com.  That means any findings from your analysis of these data are tentative -- there's no guarantee that this sample of movies is representative of the population of all movies.\n",
